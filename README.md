This is a simple demonstration of a REST HTTP server with a 
minimal, supervised, non-persistent Model process. 

Hopefully it is easy to extend.

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Run tests with `mix test`
3. View routes with `mix phoenix.routes`
4. Start the Phoenix REST server with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
