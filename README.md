phoenix-rest-server is a barebones REST HTTP server  
built using the Elixir Phoenix Framework. It uses Erlang 
OTP to provide a simple, crash-resistant, in-memory Model 
process which may be helpful to developers just getting 
started. 

Hopefully it is easy to extend.

To start the application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Run tests with `mix test`
3. View routes with `mix phoenix.routes`
4. Start the Phoenix REST server with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
